# BeanieGarden

This is a pet project for improving the state of your garden. It is a web application that allows you to track the state of your garden and the plants you have in it. The purpose is to generate a set of tasks from your garden content that contains well described rationales and subtasks.

The application is written in Typescript (SvelteKit) + Rust and uses PostgreSQL as a database.
